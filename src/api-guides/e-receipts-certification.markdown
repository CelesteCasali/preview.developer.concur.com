# User App Certification Flow

## Certification Process Flow

Once you sign the partnership agreement with the SAP Concur Business Development manager, you will receive a welcome letter. When you are ready to start the development project you'll need to follow the steps below to complete the User App certification.

1. You submit the Readiness Form using the link in the Welcome Letter.

2. SAP Concur Certification Project Manager (CPM) on duty prepares the development environment and Development App for you.
   
3. The CPM sends the development environment details and certification requirements to your technical lead via [PlatformCertification@sap.com](mailto:platformcertification@sap.com). **Note**: You'll use this email for all correspondence with the CPM.

4. You develop and test the Development App in your development environment.

5. You send an email to the CPM to schedule the Development App certification one month before the certification week. The CPM will send the meeting invitation to your technical contact. Please find your certification date on the [certification calendar](user-app-certification-calender.pdf).

6. The CPM conducts the Development App certification walkthrough on the scheduled date. If your app fails in the Development App certification walkthrough, you'll need to fix the issues and goes back to step 6 to reschedule the certification walkthrough. Please refer to the [Certification Check List](#certification-check-list) for the certification requirements. 

7. The CPM prepares the Production App and sends App credentials to you.

8. You deploy and test the Production App in your production environment. 

9.  Your marketing team submits App listing documents and images to the CPM. This step could happen at anytime before step 9. Please refer to [App Center Listing](/api-guides/e-receipts.html#creating-and-updating-an-app-center-listing) for more information.

10. The CPM and marketing team review and approve the listing documents, and send the confirmation to your marketing team. You need this approval before moving to step 12. 

11. You email the CPM to schedule the Production App certification one month before the certification week. The CPM will send the meeting invitation to your technical contact. Please find your certification date on the [certification calendar](user-app-certification-calender.pdf).

12. The CPM conducts the Production App certification walkthrough on the scheduled date. If your app fails in the Production App certification walkthrough, you'll need to fix the issues and goes back to step 12 to schedule the next certification walkthrough. Please refer to [Certification Check List](#certification-check-list) for the certification requirements. 

13. Once the certification project is complete, the CPM sends you the Certification Notification.
