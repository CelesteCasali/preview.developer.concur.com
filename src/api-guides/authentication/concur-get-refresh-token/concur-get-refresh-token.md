4. Click **OK** after you have saved this information to a text file.

## Setup the Node.js App

1. Get the [Node.js sample code](https://preview.developer.concur.com/api-guides/authentication/concur-get-refresh-token/GetRefreshToken.js).
2. Open `SampleCode/Tutorial_1/GetRefreshToken.js` in your IDE or text editor.

## Generate Your Credentials File

1. Type `node GetRefreshToken.js` in terminal to run the app to generate your `credentials.json` file. This generates messages in the terminal that show the credentials object.

2. Fill in the empty fields in this file with the information in the credential object.

## Generate Your Refresh Token

1. Run the app again. The app will call the Oauth2 /token endpoint using your credentials and generate your refresh token.
2. Check if your credentials were transferred from the JSON file to the credentials object. 
3. Check for a successful validity check on the credentials object.
4. Check for a successful API call. The status code will be 2xx and the refresh token will be one of the refresh token object properties.
