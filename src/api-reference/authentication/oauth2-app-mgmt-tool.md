# OAuth 2.0 Application Management Tool

The OAuth 2.0 Application Management tool enables clients who have Client Web Services to generate Client IDs (App IDs) and Client Secrets without contacting SAP Concur support. It also enables clients to create OAuth 2.0 compliant applications. In order to complete the workflow, you must first contact Client Web Services to request that the OAuth 2.0 Application Management tool be enabled for your entity.

Once the tool is enabled, an admin with the Web Services Administrator role will have a link to the OAuth 2.0 Application Management tool on the Authentication Administration page.

>**NOTE**: For admins working with Standard entities, a user with the **Can Administer** permission has the Web Services Administrator role.

The OAuth 2.0 Application Management tool enables clients to do the following:

* Create new OAuth 2.0 apps.
* Edit previously created OAuth 2.0 apps.
* Generate Client IDs (App IDs) and Client Secrets.
*	Generate new Client Secrets for previously created apps.
*	Search for and sort OAuth 2.0 applications.
*	View information about previously created apps such as Client ID, App Name, App Description, Date Created, and Last Modified.

## Data Center Availability

This tool is currently available in the US2, EU2, and APJ1 data centers.
