# API Release Notes, July 2025

## New This Month

### Preview: New Attributes for Spend User v4.1

The Spend User v4.1 API will allow you to access the `processorReportAccess` field in the User Preference extension. In addition, the User extension will allow you to access the following office location fields: `officeLocationCountry`, `officeLocationStateProvince`, `officeLocationCity`.

### Preview: Support for IPv6

The SAP Concur platform will support IPv6 for network communication to and from SAP Concur solutions. This implementation is expected for Q4/2025. Previously, IPv6 was only supported for inbound HTTPS calls, and all other inbound and outbound calls supported only IPv4. 

>**Note:** SAP recommends adding domains (for example, *.concursolutions.com) to your allow lists rather than specific IP addresses. SAP does not anticipate any interruption in functionality; however, clients who use allow lists or otherwise restrict SAP Concur IP addresses might need to update their lists to accommodate new IPv6 address ranges.

**Configuration / Feature Activation**

In most cases, this change is transparent, and no configuration or activation steps are required. Clients and partners who use allow lists to filter traffic received from SAP Concur solutions might need to update their lists.

>**Note:** SAP does not recommend filtering or restricting network communication based on IP addresses. If your company requires specific IP addresses, contact SAP Concur support or your SAP Concur representative for assistance.

### Now Available: Updates to OAuth 2.0 Application Management

We have updated the OAuth 2.0 Application Management tool, which is used to create apps for integrations. We have introduced two new fields: `App Stage` and `Application Type`. These fields provide drop-down lists from which you can select the appropriate value, facilitating better categorization and management of your apps. The update rollout started on July 9th, and the changes are expected to be reflected across all data centers by the end of the same week. For detailed information, check out the [OAuth 2.0 Application Management Tool](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/oauth2-app-mgmt-tool.html) documentation.

### Now Available: Hotel Service v4 New Field

The `highlightedRateText` field has been added to the Rate Response model for the `/hotels/rates` endpoint in the Hotel Service v4 API. This is an optional field of type `string`.

### Deprecation: Attendee Types v3 API

Effective July 1, 2025, the Attendee Types v3 API was deprecated. This has been replaced by Attendee Types v4. Decommission will follow.

### Deprecation: Attendees v3 API

Effective July 1, 2025, the Attendees v3 API was deprecated. This has been replaced by Attendees v4. Decommission will follow.

## Ongoing

### Deprecation: Expense v3 DELETE

### Preview: Public Certificate Root Change

To maintain compliance with evolving security standards and ensure uninterrupted compatibility with Mozilla-based browsers, we are transitioning our digital certificates to the updated DigiCert Global Root G2 and G3 authorities:

* DigiCert Global Root G2 – for RSA-based certificates

* DigiCert Global Root G3 – for ECDSA-based certificates

This proactive update follows DigiCert’s announcement regarding Mozilla’s planned deprecation of the DigiCert Global Root CA.

Adopting the new root certificates is critical to avoid potential trust errors or connection issues when accessing our services via Mozilla browsers.

Target Implementation Dates:

Certificate|Implementation Date
---|---
*.concurcdc.cn|Oct 2, 2025
*.api.concurcdc.cn|Oct 9, 2025
*.concursolutions.com|Oct 23, 2025
*.api.concursolutions.com|Nov 6, 2025

Clients who have not pinned the certificate do not need to take any action as the new certificate will automatically be updated when it becomes available. 

#### RECOMMENDATION – Please Read Carefully

**Certificate pinning is not recommended.**

While it may add a layer of control, pinning certificates introduces risks. Certificates used by SAP Concur are renewed on a regular basis. Pinned certificates are not updated automatically and may cause service disruptions if not updated before implementation date.

#### FOR SAP ICS Customers

Please refer to section 2 “**Which SSL certificates do I need to have installed**” of [2914977 - FAQ: Concur Certificates, Authentication, and Connectivity](https://me.sap.com/notes/2914977) for detailed instructions.

#### ACTION REQUIRED

If your systems **pin** the root or intermediate certificate, you must update your trust store to include the following certificates:

* Intermediate: [DigiCert Global G2 TLS RSA SHA256 2020 CA1](https://cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertGlobalG2TLSRSASHA2562020CA1-1.crt.pem?_gl=1*i7c9wi*_gcl_au*MTI2NjY3MzYyMC4xNzMyNTAwNTAw)

**ECDSA Certificates Download Links**

> Note: Most modern systems now prefer **ECDSA** for connections, while **RSA** is still used primarily by legacy systems. To ensure full compatibility, please ensure that your systems trust both **ECDSA and RSA certificates**.

**CERTIFICATE CHAIN LINKS**: (consist of end-entity, Intermediate, and Root certificates respectively). If your system is pinning the end-entity certificate, see the links below.
Please make sure to open the link in an Incognito or Private browser window to ensure there is no cached data causing outdated or incorrect content to appear.
