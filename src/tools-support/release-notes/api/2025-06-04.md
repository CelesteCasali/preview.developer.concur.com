# API Release Notes, June 2025

## New This Month

### Important: Deprecation Notification Change

We have updated our Deprecation Policy to remove the 30-day notice prior to Deprecation. We will continue to notify of Deprecated APIs in release notes. Note that APIs will remain in Deprecated status for a minimum of twelve months prior to full Decommissioning unless in exceptional circumstances as defined in the policy.

### Now Available: Expense v4 DELETE APIs – Reports v4, Expenses v4

The Expense Report Service API suite includes APIs to delete unsubmitted reports and expenses. These APIs include support for both User and Company JWTs.

### Deprecation: Expense v3 DELETE

Effective June 26, 2025, Expense v3 DELETE was deprecated. This has been replaced by Expense v4 Delete. Decommission will follow.

### Deprecation: Expense Group Configurations v3

Effective June 26, 2025, the Expense Group Configurations v3 API was deprecated. This has been replaced by the Expense Configuration v4 API. Decommission will follow.


### Now Available: Updates to the Expense Configuration v4 API

The Expense Configuration Service has released GET API operations, as follows: 

* GET Attendee Types for a User's Expense Group v4 API

GET Attendee Types v4 API operations allow you to retrieve all attendee types applicable to the user's expense group based on their `userId`. 

* GET User Expense Groups v4 API

GET Groups v4 API operations allow you to retrieve an expense group applicable to a user based on their `userId`, including policies, payment types and attendee types linked to the group. 

* GET Company Expense Groups v4 API 

GET Company Groups v4 API operations allow you to retrieve all expense groups applicable for a company based on their `companyID`. 

* GET Company Expense Groups by ID v4 API

GET Company Groups by Id v4 API operations allow you to retrieve an expense group by `id`, including policies, payment types and attendee types linked to the group.

### Preview: Detokenizer (DTK) v5 API

The FIPS Compliant v5 Credit Card Detokenization API will be set to launch within the CCPS environment for IBCP customers. This compliance-driven initiative aligns with the Federal Information Processor Standards (FIPS) to ensure robust protection of sensitive data, per U.S. federal requirements. For customers with entities in CCPS and IBCP card programs, the new Detokenizer (DTK) functionality will be integral to the payment file process. 

>**Note:** The current v4 API service will remain unchanged for other environments.

**Overview**

The Detokenizer service ensures secure transmission of sensitive data (card number) to customers as part of the remittance file creation process running at caller applications like ICS and CWS, in which the full, unmasked credit card number is required for the correct application of payments.

**API Details**

The Detokenizer v5 API exposes the following resources and these must be called sequentially:

Resource|Description
---|---
RSAPublicKey|Retrieves the RSA public Key via public key API
Credit Card Account Details|Retrieves the credit card number via Detokenizer API

The first DTK v5 API will return the RSA public key and version of the RSA public key. The caller needs to wrap their symmetric key using this public key and this wrapped symmetric key needs to be passed to the second DTK v5 API along with the version earlier mentioned, and the mandatory credit card GUID received from client request to provide encrypted credit card account number.

### Preview: Deprecation of Attendees v3 API

Effective July 1, 2025, the Attendees v3 API will be deprecated. This has been replaced by Attendees v4. Decommission will follow.

### Preview: Public Certificate Root Change

To maintain compliance with evolving security standards and ensure uninterrupted compatibility with Mozilla-based browsers, we are transitioning our digital certificates to the updated DigiCert Global Root G2 and G3 authorities:

* DigiCert Global Root G2 – for RSA-based certificates

* DigiCert Global Root G3 – for ECDSA-based certificates

This proactive update follows DigiCert’s announcement regarding Mozilla’s planned deprecation of the DigiCert Global Root CA.

Adopting the new root certificates is critical to avoid potential trust errors or connection issues when accessing our services via Mozilla browsers.

Target Implementation Dates:

Certificate|Implementation Date
---|---
*.concurcdc.cn|Oct 2, 2025
*.api.concurcdc.cn|Oct 9, 2025
*.concursolutions.com|Oct 23, 2025
*.api.concursolutions.com|Nov 6, 2025

Clients who have not pinned the certificate do not need to take any action as the new certificate will automatically be updated when it becomes available. 

#### RECOMMENDATION – Please Read Carefully

**Certificate pinning is not recommended.**

While it may add a layer of control, pinning certificates introduces risks. Certificates used by SAP Concur are renewed on a regular basis. Pinned certificates are not updated automatically and may cause service disruptions if not updated before implementation date.

#### FOR SAP ICS Customers

Please refer to section 2 “**Which SSL certificates do I need to have installed**” of [2914977 - FAQ: Concur Certificates, Authentication, and Connectivity](https://me.sap.com/notes/2914977) for detailed instructions.

#### ACTION REQUIRED

If your systems **pin** the root or intermediate certificate, you must update your trust store to include the following certificates:

* Intermediate: [DigiCert Global G2 TLS RSA SHA256 2020 CA1](https://cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertGlobalG2TLSRSASHA2562020CA1-1.crt.pem?_gl=1*i7c9wi*_gcl_au*MTI2NjY3MzYyMC4xNzMyNTAwNTAw)

> Note: Most modern systems now prefer **ECDSA** for connections, while **RSA** is still used primarily by legacy systems. To ensure full compatibility, please ensure that your systems trust both **ECDSA and RSA certificates**.

**CERTIFICATE CHAIN LINKS**: (consist of end-entity, Intermediate, and Root certificates respectively). If your system is pinning the end-entity certificate, see the links below.
Please make sure to open the link in an Incognito or Private browser window to ensure there is no cached data causing outdated or incorrect content to appear.
